Have you tried learning a programming language before?

Not officially. I've never taken a college level CS class before, but I did learn a lot programming languages as interest - python, R, Java, Matlab. I also learned SQL, Hive, Spark for my data science hobbies - I sometimes attend competitions on Kaggle. Other than that I know a little bit C for programming my IoTs. I know Html5, CSS and Javascript as well. I learned some of the front end language when I was doing my e-commerce business at 15 - I had to learn it to decorate my e-store.

Was any part of it difficult for you?

Yeah, recursive functions and some algorithms make me feel uncomfortable. I also don't know how to learn Regex (I finished the Regex course on Codeschool.com, but keep forgetting it). I would say the only thing I'm good (like intermediate) at is Python because I had to do a lot of data science projects with it. For other languages I feel that I'm stuck, meaning not good enough to do meaningful projects but not bad enough to relearn the basics. I have trouble dive deeper into them (One example is Javascript).
I find programming more intuitive than hard - probably because I was a hard-core gamer, and I have the same attitude towards all the interesting things I learned - I would spend a lot of time on them.

Is there anything about being a Ruby developer youâ€™d like to know more about?

Yeah. Ruby vs Javascript for web dev, pros and cons, really need some insights. Real world applications.

Javascript got D3.js, does Ruby also have something for data visualization?

Recommendation about Ruby IDE? For some reasons the ruby auto-completion package is super slow on my Atom.
Local vs Cloud (Nitrous, c9)?
