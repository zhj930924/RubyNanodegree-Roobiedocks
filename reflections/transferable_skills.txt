I kind of already talked about this part in the challenges session but as a graduate from a top business undergraduate program I definitely have team skills.

Another important one is the willingness to learn - when I'm interested in something, I go for it and I will always finish (persistence maybe).

Enjoy programming might be another plus I guess? I have no fear towards learning another language. In fact I would enjoy it.

4 years of e-commerce experience would help me communicate with other people (finding partners), do web analytics and eventually build a start up with the skills I have? - entrepreneurial personality can help me succeed in dealing with obstacles and setbacks - I love challenges and they only push me forward.
